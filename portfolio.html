“You're smoking maybe six goddamn packs a day.”
<br><br>
	Whist ran her shaking hand through her hair, mindful of her ears. They always got angry if it looked like she was trying to plug her ears. Her eyes darted around. No one was glancing their way. That was unusual, considering how loud her accuser was. It wasn't quite a shout, but it was still all she could hear.
<br><br>
	“Six goddamn packs a day,” Whist muttered. Her gaze fell on the cigarette in her hand. It was the first one in a few days. But she knew better than to argue. That only made it worse. At least when she just mirrored the words back, it went away faster. With a resigned sigh, Whist took another puff.
<br><br>
	“And you're probably still taking those useless meds, right?” A laugh this time. Whist mumbled the words to herself. Still taking those useless meds. Technically, she was still on the medication, but she'd run out, and going back to the pharmacy would just create more trouble. She couldn't risk causing a scene and more people knowing –
<br><br>
	Calm down. Let it take the edge off. Whist raised the cigarette to her mouth again. Her eyes flicked around the alleyway. The streetlamps were starting to flicker on, illuminating the crumbling stone walls around her. She scratched her cheek with her free hand.
<br><br>
	“Those people staring. They know.”
<br><br>
	“They know,” said Whist into the cigarette. Maybe the lethargy couldn't be blamed on the medication. Not even the nicotine rush was helping anymore. Not like it used to. It used to fix this. Maybe she really was just –
<br><br>
	“Useless, fucked up, goddamn good-for-nothing split-minded freak!”
<br><br>
	The cigarette fell from her hands. It smoldered as she covered her ears and stamped it out. She shook her head. But even then she was repeating the words.
<br><br>
	“Useless,” Whist said to the ruined cigarette. “Fucked up... goddamn... good-for-nothing... split-minded freak--”
<br><br>
	Her claws dug into her head. Maybe they'd draw blood and she could feel something for the first time since she got put on the medication. Whist sat down on the curbside, her legs threatening to give out from underneath her. Dimly, she realized she'd sat on her tail. But she couldn't move anymore. If she did, it'd only attract more attention.
<br><br>
	“Miss, are you alright?” Someone who didn't know. Someone who was oblivious. Maybe the rumors hadn't reached them. But if they were asking, then she'd drawn attention to herself again.
<br><br>
	Whist stared at her feet. There was a splotch of blood on the toe of her shoe. It looked fresh.
<br><br>
	“Are you alright?” Whist repeated back.
<br><br>
	There was a pause. Everything was silent and distant, except for the pounding of blood in her ears. When Whist looked up, the alleyway was empty. Nobody was there.
<br><br>
	Holding the wall, Whist stood up. Her legs trembled more than they should have. She reached into her vest pocket and thumbed out another cigarette, her other hand going for the lighter. Leaning against the wall, she fumbled the lighter's switch a few times. Finally, with the unlit cigarette hanging from her mouth, she lit it. Inhaling deeply, she closed her eyes and sighed, smoke billowing from her mouth.
<br><br>
	There was never anyone there.
